    description: 'This story was published in response to ICEâ€™s policy regarding international visa and immigration status amid COVID-19 and school reopening. For this story, I worked with Jiachuan Wu, my colleague at NBC News over the summer, to scrape college tuition data and F and J visa data over the years. We processed these data in a spreadsheet. I also worked on making the map and the bar chart in illustrator and D3geo. Jiachuan added a toggle to the maps.',
